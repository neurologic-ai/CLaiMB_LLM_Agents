"""
Enterprise Systems Metric Grader — ONE-SHOT (per metric)

- Universal preamble + per-metric rubric
- Each metric includes: example_input AND example_output (true one-shot)
- build_prompt prints the RESPONSE FORMAT before EXAMPLES to reduce anchoring
- input_key_meanings documents expected evidence fields for every metric
- Public API: one wrapper method per metric (20 total)

Schema (LLM output):
  {"metric_id","band","rationale","flags","gaps"}

Rationale guidance:
  Name the strongest positive AND the main limiting factor (≤3 sentences).

Gaps guidance:
  Use action-plan phrasing:
  "<limiter> → <what to change> → <target threshold> (unlocks band X)".

Backward-compat shim:
  _ask() mirrors `band` -> `Score` and stamps `MetricID` so the current
  EnterpriseOrchestrator (which calls _s(metric["Score"])) keeps working.
